He also played violin and trombone and began writing a newspaper column on jazz for the Empire Star Weekly when he was thirteen. He enrolled as an evening student at Millard Fillmore College, the night school division of the University of Buffalo, and worked as a clerk at the Buffalo public library during the day. His writing ability was quickly recognized, and he moved into the bachelor of arts program at the University of Buffalo. He withdrew in 1960 because of a \"dire shortage of funds\" (Gates) and a \"wide gap between social classes\" (Gates). To escape \"the artificial social and class distinctions that he associated with American university education,\" (Gates) he moved to Buffalo's Talbert Mall Project.

Freeman is a scholar of seventeenth century British literature who has compiled an impressively eclectic array of publications and research projects. Educated at Amherst College (AB 1956) and the University of Minnesota (PhD 1968), Freeman joined the faculty in the English Department at UMass shortly after completing his doctorate. He has published on topics ranging from Latin and Greek poets to Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Tennyson, James Agee, Donald Duck, 17th century regicides, and 1930s radio. He has also served as a regular contributor and editor for the Association for Gravestone Studies Quarterly. The Freeman collection consists of many hundreds of cassette tapes of radio broadcasts from the 1930s through early 1950s, reflecting the culture of commercial radio during its golden age. The collection includes representatives of most of the major genres, including comedy, drama, suspense and mystery, soap operas, and westerns. There is some depth popular programs such as Amos and Andy, the Great Gildersleeve, Philip Marlowe, and Nero Wolfe, but the collection also includes less common and short-lived shows.","_xxxcollectionOwnerNamextxt":"UMass Amherst Libraries, Special Collections & University Archives","_xxxcollectionTitlextxt":"James A.

The MMP Records contain over ten linear feet of CD and DVD masters of uncut interviews and produced radio shows. Shows, including Heart of the Matter and A World of Possibilities, explore promising new thinking and experimentation in fields ranging from energy, food, water, and wilderness to human rights, global security, and public health, and include interviews with leading experts and innovators, such as Studs Terkel, Pete Seeger, Laurie Garrett, Wangari Maathai, Frances Moore Lappe, Howard Gardner, Lily Yeh, Robert Reich, Majora Carter, Van Jones and many more.

The collection also includes recordings of programs and speeches made by public figures during and beyond WW II, including Churchill, Eisenhower, Einstein, Hitler, and JFK. As Dr. Donald Godfrey writes in his 1973 article \"History Held a Microphone\": \"There are twenty-two hundred and twenty-seven newscasts. All but a handful originating from CBS. Their newscasts represent every weekday without a miss, from September 7, 1939, with the Germans entering Poland, to April 2, 1945, with the allies entering Germany.... Tapes contain examples of special events coverage: the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, the bombing of Japan, landings in North Africa, the 13 Normandy Invasion, the World Security Conference, April, 1945, the function of the American and Russian Armies, April, 1945, the death and funeral of FDR, and miles of tape on V. E. and V.J. days. Elmer Davis' daily five minute reports are represented in entirety from his debut, September 16, 1939, to February 13, 1941, and occasionally to July 9, 1943. H. V. Kaltenbom edits the news, complete from August 27, 1939, until January 26, 1940, and sporadically thereafter.

The collection consists of nearly 150 linear feet of papers and also includes scrapbooks, books, photographs, and film and sound recordings. For the most part, the arrangement of the collection reflects the original filing series of Senator Williams's office. The collection is divided into 25 series which are organized under four record subgroups. The first three subgroups--Legislative Staff/Office Files, Constituent Correspondence and Cases, and Administrative and Personal Office Files--consist of series that document the work performed in office by Senator Williams and his staff. The subgroups reflect the functions of the Senator's work and include series typical of a congressional collection. Duties reflected in the Legislative Staff/Office Files include committee, legislative, and investigative work. The Constituent Correspondence and Cases subgroup includes materials created in response to the concerns and interests of constituents, and those filed on receipt of issue-related opinions from the general public. The Administrative and Personal Office Files reflect the management of the office and the Senator's personal schedule. The fourth subgroup, Personal, includes series of files and other formats that document the personal activities and opinions of Senator Williams. The material in these files supplements information about his Senate career in the first three subgroups. There is also material from the 1970s and about Mrs. Williams and Senator Williams's family life.

The AFRS network was launched with a five hour broadcast on July 4, 1943. The network quickly grew and by the end of World War II included 300 stations, broadcasting to troops around the world. Programs were distributed to stations on 16\" polyvinyl discs that contained fifteen minutes of information. Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra and other major stars of the day performed on the network free of charge as their contribution to the war effort. Radio networks and record labels provided free access their programming and recordings to help develop programming for the network. In addition to bringing the troops programming from networks and the record labels, the service also created original programs like Jubilee which featured African American bands and entertainers. The AFRS network continued broadcasting through Korea, Vietnam and other subsequent wars and conflicts. Now known as the Armed Forces Network, the service continues to entertain servicemen and servicewomen stationed around the world.","_xxxcollectionOwnerNamextxt":"Marr Sound Archives","_xxxcollectionTitlextxt":"United States Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRS) Collection","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"12,248 items","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":["Pressed LP disc"],"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Performed music","Spoken word"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":["Radio programs","Radio serials"],"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Missouri"}},{"data":{"_xxxid":"collection_1395","scd_publish_status":"all-information-public","_xxxcollectionDescriptionxtxt":"Mimeographed daily broadcast content reports of the U.S. Information Agency, Broadcast Service, Munich Radio Center, the \"Voice of America.\" The reports are from the end of November 1954 through May 1956.","_xxxcollectionOwnerNamextxt":"Rare Book and Manuscript Collections, Butler Library","_xxxcollectionTitlextxt":"United States Information Agency Broadcast Service records","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"19 boxes","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"https://clio.columbia.edu/archives/4078210","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"New York"}},{"data":{"_xxxid":"collection_1652","scd_publish_status":"all-information-public","_xxxcollectionDescriptionxtxt":"Includes an incomplete set of scripts and programs, scrapbooks, correspondence and newsclippings concerning radio programs on technology and science aired on The World Is Yours.","_xxxcollectionOwnerNamextxt":"National Museum of American History","_xxxcollectionTitlextxt":"United States National Museum.
