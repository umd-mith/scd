NFCB's early mission also included the creation of training manuals for radio station staff, assisting stations in obtaining Federal Communication Commission licenses, and promoting the participation of minorities and women in public broadcasting. The collection documents NFCB's administrative activities, its work with member stations and community groups, training and licensing work, as well as its advocacy work and radio awards programs. A significant portion of the collection comprises the audio reels and paper records of the NFCB Program Service, which promoted the sharing of content among community radio stations by collecting and distributing radio programs created by independent producers from across the United States, many of which have been digitized.","collection_holder_name":["Special Collections in Mass Media & Culture, University of Maryland"],"collection_title":"National Federation of Community Broadcasters collection","collection_extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"collection_finding_aid_url":"http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1596","collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Maryland"}},{"data":{"collection_id":"collection_985","scd_publish_status":"all-information-public","collection_description":"Includes material relating to the work of the National Association of Television and Radio Farm Directors, mostly 1950s, and other radio addresses.","collection_holder_name":["Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections"],"collection_title":"National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry Records","collection_extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"collection_finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"New York"}},{"data":{"collection_id":"collection_1067","scd_publish_status":"all-information-public","collection_description":"Contains correspondence, reports, articles, program scripts, contracts, copyright certificates, program listings, publicity materials and form letters relating to the Department's involvement in administering its radio programs, including Children's Chapel and Invitation for Tomorrow, its television program light Time and its participation in the CBS radio program Church of the Air.

For the most part, the arrangement of the collection reflects the original filing series of Senator Williams's office. The collection is divided into 25 series which are organized under four record subgroups. The first three subgroups--Legislative Staff/Office Files, Constituent Correspondence and Cases, and Administrative and Personal Office Files--consist of series that document the work performed in office by Senator Williams and his staff. The subgroups reflect the functions of the Senator's work and include series typical of a congressional collection. Duties reflected in the Legislative Staff/Office Files include committee, legislative, and investigative work. The Constituent Correspondence and Cases subgroup includes materials created in response to the concerns and interests of constituents, and those filed on receipt of issue-related opinions from the general public. The Administrative and Personal Office Files reflect the management of the office and the Senator's personal schedule. The fourth subgroup, Personal, includes series of files and other formats that document the personal activities and opinions of Senator Williams. The material in these files supplements information about his Senate career in the first three subgroups.

In addition to bringing the troops programming from networks and the record labels, the service also created original programs like Jubilee which featured African American bands and entertainers.
