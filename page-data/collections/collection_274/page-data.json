These are on 1/4\" reel to reel tape. We have a small amount of documentation between TNS and the station(s) and surmise that The New School had a relationship with WBAI or Pacifica to record and broadcast lectures/programs featuring well-known participants. The Pacifica Radio Archive lists at least some of these recordings in its online catalog.","extent":null,"collectionFormats":["Reel-to-reel"],"content_types":null,"finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"New York","collection_holder_city":"New York","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":"Related to TV, so perhaps not relevant, but worth mentioning: \"We also have some files from the 1950s related to TNS's early ventures into educational television, although we do not have any of the actual recordings of these ventures.\"","collection_usage_statement":null,"website_url":null,"record_type":"collection","collection_holder_category":["College or University"],"collection_content_category":["Recorded Sound","Other"],"physical_formats":["Reel-to-reel"],"creators":null,"subjects":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
