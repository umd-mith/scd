The station operated out of the Centennial building. A few years later, on February 4, 1966, the station received FCC licensing and began FM broadcasting. After moving to a studio in Cook Hall, the station broadcast with only 10 watts of power which was enough to reach student dormitories. By the 1970's, WGLT became a full member of the National Public Radio network and was later broadcasting at 25,000 watts. Offered as a public service of the university, the station currently offers talk and news programming as well as online streaming music channels that include blues, jazz, and acoustic music. The station's call sign is an acronym for \"Gladly Learn Teach\" which is a take on the university's motto: Gladly we learn and teach.\n\nNote written by April Karlene Anderson (pulled from public finding aid)","subjects":["College radio stations - United States","Illinois State University","Public radio - Illinois - Normal","Radio stations - Illinois - Normal","Poetry reading"],"creators":["WGLT (Radio station : Normal, Ill.)
