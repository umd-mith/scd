In some cases, we have a CD or DVD containing a copy of the original recording. In many cases, we have already transferred the entire contents of these tapes to a computer hard drive. We use Adobe Cool-edit software, and the tracks are stored a Mp3 files. These recording are, for the most part, un processed. However, some \\\"EQ\\\" or equalization may have been done to \"clean up\" the recording and filter out rumbling lows, or tone down hiss and excessive high frequencies. Our recordings are, in most cases, very clean and easy to listen to. In many cases they were made from \\\"master\\\" recordings that suffered little or no loss, despite their age. There are some records and transcriptions, as well a few original digital records of more recent events. Not all materials have been digitized, and some entire collections are awaiting transfer, and are therefore, still in the original condition we received them in.
