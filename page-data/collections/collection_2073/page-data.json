Utley Papers","collection_description":"The bulk of the collection consists of scripts, both radio and television, 1930-1960, with only three scripts prior to 1935. Includes scripts for special programs such as The War That Must Not Come, April 16, 1946, and for occasions on which Utley substituted for other commentators such as H. V. Kaltenbom and Joseph Harsch. Also includes scripts for dramatizations in which Utley participated or which he moderated such as the historical series entitled We Came This Way, 1944-1945, and Quiz Kids, 1946. Also includes fan mail and other correspondence. Utley broadcast his news reports and commentary over several Chicago stations, but the majority of the work originated from the NBC stations WMAQ and WNBQ, either for local or network broadcast.","collection_extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"collection_finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Wisconsin","collection_holder_city":"Madison","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"collection_website_url":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
