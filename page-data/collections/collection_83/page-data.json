Few of the tapes are dated, but those that are cover a span from 1965 to 1979. Announcers or presenters are rarely identified. The news items include a mix of national and local productions, but there are relatively few in the collection compared to the concert recordings. Many concerts were given by popular artists such as Pink Floyd, Bonnie Raitt, Canned Heat, Niels Lofgren, and Commander Cody, taken from national broadcasts, mostly originating from New York City or Boston. The collection contains recordings of only a handful of concerts broadcast by Syracuse University student ensembles. 25 tapes are identified as having been recorded on-campus at the Jabberwocky Caf√©; surviving performances from this intimate venue include those given by John Fahey, Taj Mahal, and David Bromberg.","collection_extent":"258 \"Reel-to-Reel\" tapes","collectionFormats":["Reel-to-reel"],"content_types":null,"collection_finding_aid_url":"http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/w/waer.htm","collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"New York","collection_holder_city":"Syracuse","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"collection_website_url":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
