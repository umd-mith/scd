Coverage is best for programming and operations of the individual stations. The files include a fairly comprehensive collection of program guides for KPFA, KPFK and WBAI and operational material chiefly for KPFA and KPFK. Although the remainder of the collection pertains to Pacifica in general, there is little documentation on overall policymaking. One box contains correspondence, memos, a printed history, personnel lists, financial information, program and station guidelines, newsletters, minutes of national meetings and general information on affiliates and tape sales. Another half box concerns investigations of Pacifica by the U.S. Senate and the FCC over alleged communist infiltration and the use of obscenity on the air.","collection_extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"collection_finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Wisconsin","collection_holder_city":"Madison","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"collection_website_url":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
