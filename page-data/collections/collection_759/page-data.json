Large collection of audio masters on reel-to-reel polyester tape of radionovela (radio soap opera) programs produced by the America's Production Inc. in Miami, Florida during the late 1960s. The company was created by Louis J. Boeri who saw an opportunity to fill the void in Spanish-language radio programming after the collapse of the industry in post-revolutionary Cuba. The programs were produced, written, and performed by a group consisting primarily of professionals, writers, technicians, and performing artists who left Cuba during or just after the 1959 Revolution and Mexican writers as well. In addition to the tapes, there is a small amount of marketing print material that describes the production process and provides program catalogs with synopses of many of the radionovelas produced by API that were licensed to radio stations across Latin America, the United States, and Europe. A small selection of titles and episodes have been dubbed onto compact discs and are available for consultation. There is also a small amount of video and film related to the production of a telenovela (television soap opera).","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":null,"_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Recorded Sound"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Louisiana","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":["Spanish"],"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"New Orleans","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
