There are also interviews with national figures like Allen Ginsberg, Native American poet and filmmaker Sherman Alexie, Edward Abbey, Cesar Chavez, Annie Liebovitz, George McGovern, Ramsey Clark, Amory Lovins and hundreds of others. In addition there are live recorded programs documenting marches, demonstrations, community meetings and other events that give ‘you are there’ discussions with participants and reportage from behind the scenes. Special programs on KBOO history are also represented.","physical_formats":["Computer disc","Audio disc","Audiocassette","Audiotape reel","Sheet","Optical disc (including CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, VCD)","MiniDisc","Analog audiocassette","Digital Audio Tape","Open reel tape (unknown material)","Digital audio file (including MP3, WAV, AIFF, etc.)","Text document"],"access_statement":"KBOO is in the process of cataloging all analog audio records to provide search and discovery of its holdings to the general public.
