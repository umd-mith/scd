The KBOO tape archives include exclusive interviews with Oregonians Bob Packwood, Ken Kesey (five separate programs), William Stafford, Gus Van Sant, Ursula Le Guin (six programs over as many years) and Portlander Ben Linder who was murdered by Contras while volunteering in Nicaragua. There are also interviews with national figures like Allen Ginsberg, Native American poet and filmmaker Sherman Alexie, Edward Abbey, Cesar Chavez, Annie Liebovitz, George McGovern, Ramsey Clark, Amory Lovins and hundreds of others. In addition there are live recorded programs documenting marches, demonstrations, community meetings and other events that give ‘you are there’ discussions with participants and reportage from behind the scenes. Special programs on KBOO history are also represented.","subjects":["KBOO News","Public affairs radio programming","KRAB nebula","Pacifica Radio","Alternative Radio","Agee, Philip","Andresen, Glen (local authority)","Barsamian, David","Benjamin, Medea, 1952-","Bennis, Phyllis, 1951-","Bush, George W.
