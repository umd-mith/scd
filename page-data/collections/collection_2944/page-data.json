The media library supported Sarkisian’s research and recording career at VOA (1963-2012) and served as the principal analog audio resources for the production of the Music Time in Africa radio show.  The collection also includes personal papers and memorabilia from Leo Sarkisian and his wife Mary. New materials in digital form are added to the collection as tape recordings and personal papers are digitized.

Ethnomusicologist Leo Sarkisian created the weekly program using hundreds of hours of original field recordings he made in over thirty-eight newly decolonized African nations. These recordings, combined with selections from his extensive library of contemporary and rare commercial recordings, formed the thirty-minute broadcasts that he scripted and produced. The digitized collection includes the most complete copy of every extant radio program broadcast between 1966 and 2004, comprising nearly 900 digital files representing entire programs or just the musical selections. The online search and delivery system provides access to the audio portion, associated digitized scripts, thumbnail illustrations of Sarkisian’s artwork, and descriptive metadata documenting hosts, geographic locations of the music, and performers.\n\nThe heart and soul of the Leo Sarkisian Archive are the recordings made or fostered by Sarkisian over a thirty-year period, forming one of the top four collections of African musical heritage. His recordings span traditional music, popular music (jazz bands to Afro-funk), gospel, and African-composed classical music. Sarkisian was the first ethnomusicologist to train African sound engineers, enabling African-initiated music archiving and ensuring the preservation of African musical heritage. The Sarkisian collection, a collective achievement enriched by many, includes both his own field recordings and those made by trained sound engineers across the continent. In 2012, the Library of Congress inducted MTiA into the National Registry of Recorded Sound, highlighting a show from 29 July 1973 on the music of Mauritania. The online version of MTiA offers a first-time listening experience beyond the African continent and is one of the largest and most complete assemblies of radio broadcasts with readable and searchable program scripts.","subjects":null,"creators":["Sarkisian, Leo, 1921-2018","Voice of America"],"physical_formats":["Pressed LP disc","Pressed 45rpm disc","Optical disc (including CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, VCD)","Analog audiocassette","Polyester open reel tape","Acetate open reel tape","Digital audio file (including MP3, WAV, AIFF, etc.)","Photographic negative","Text document"],"access_statement":"Portions available for online streaming and image download.
