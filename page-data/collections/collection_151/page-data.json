As a general trade association, the Society was somewhat unusual in that it represented both the giant chemical firms and small finishers and molders. In its early years, the Society was a loose organization which brought its members together for socializing and informal exchanges over dinner and on the golf links. While the activities of the Societyhave become more structured and sophisticated as the industryhas matured, the social aspect is still a prominent feature of its annual meetings and expositions.","extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Delaware","collection_holder_city":"Wilmington","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"website_url":null,"record_type":"collection","collection_holder_category":["Museum","Indepenedent research facility"],"collection_content_category":null,"physical_formats":null,"creators":null,"subjects":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
