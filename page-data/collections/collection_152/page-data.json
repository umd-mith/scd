This approach typified much of the private residential and commercial construction of the period and stood in contrast to the austere modernism of contemporary architects. Pahlmann also played a major role in organizing and elevating the status of interior design as a profession.","collection_extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"collection_finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Delaware","collection_holder_city":"Wilmington","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"collection_website_url":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
