KSFO was known for their news and sports coverage, as well as the voice talents of such personalities as Don Sherwood, Russ Hodges, Lon Simmons, and Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins. The majority of this collection involves station marketing, promotions, and fundraisers, although there are airchecks and other broadcast recordings. Production library material includes jingles, themes, music beds, promotional spots, and advertising. Physical media in the KSFO collection is primarily audio on tape (around 650 objects), with some video (largely U-Matic cassettes), 16mm film (four reels), photographs, slides, and ephemera (eight scrapbooks of printed matter).","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"36 boxes","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":["Polyester open reel tape","Motion picture film","U-matic (including U-matic S)","Photographic print","Text document"],"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Performed music","Spoken word","Still image","Textual or Photographic Materials","Two-dimensional moving image"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":["Radio programs","Radio news programs","Radio sports events","Radio station identifications"],"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"California","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":["EAD finding aid","Online catalog record"],"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":["English"],"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Stanford","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":"http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt458035s1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
