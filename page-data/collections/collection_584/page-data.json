The concert was broadcast on NPR, on WNYC-FM. Reporter Andrew Berger provided commentary for each piece, using the composers' biographies and additional information about the pieces. During intermission on Reel 1, Berger conducts a taped interview of the members of the string quartet, who share their personal experiences of performing with Primavera, and talk about Tchaikovsky's Third string quartet, a memorial dedicated to his friendship of Ferdinand Laub. The interview resumed on Reel 2, followed by the rest of the concert. Five songs for string quartet are arranged from these George Gershwin songs: 1. \"He loves, [and] she loves,\" 2. \"Fascinating rhythm,\" 3. \"Do it again,\" \"Clap yo' hands,\" and 5. \"Sweet and low down.\" A surprise encore of an unidentified Kurt Weill arrangement is also performed.","collection_holder_category":["Municipal"],"collection_holder_name":["New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B.
