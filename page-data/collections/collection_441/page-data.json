Mimaroğlu talks about his studies at Columbia University thanks to a Rockefeller Scholarship, and in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Center with Vladimir Ussachevsky and Edgard Varèse. He speaks about his life and career as a music critic and clarinetist in Turkey, and later as a composer in Turkey and the United States, and his work with Freddie Hubbard. Being one of the early pioneers of electronic music, he explains the way he produces \"tape music\" at a sound recording studio, and how he mixes this music together with jazz and other types of music, with vocals, and the spoken word. He describes this electronic music as political music. The composer discusses each of the following works, excerpts of which are then played during the interview: three excerpts from Sing me a song of Songmy (The crowd, What a good time for a Kent State, and The black soldier), Tract, La Rouche, and Wings of the delirious demon.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"1 recording","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Recorded Sound"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"http://catalog.nypl.org/search~S1?/X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D/X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D&SUBKEY=%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29/101%2C1177%2C1177%2CB/frameset&FF=X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D&141%2C141%2C","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
