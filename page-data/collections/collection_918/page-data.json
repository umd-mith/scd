Many of the pieces, primarily 1930s and 1940s, include photographs of the individuals or groups (bands, orchestras etc.) who are identified as radio performers. Also includes a large collection of band and orchestra arrangements that were used by WEEI's orchestra until it was disbanded. Note: Because the sheet music, only some of which is listed in the online catalog, is filed by title, a researcher would have to see the actual cover to determine if it included a photograph of a radio personality.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":null,"_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Textual or Photographic Materials"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Rhode Island","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Providence","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
