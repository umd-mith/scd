Many of the pieces, primarily 1930s and 1940s, include photographs of the individuals or groups (bands, orchestras etc.) who are identified as radio performers. Also includes a large collection of band and orchestra arrangements that were used by WEEI's orchestra until it was disbanded. Note: Because the sheet music, only some of which is listed in the online catalog, is filed by title, a researcher would have to see the actual cover to determine if it included a photograph of a radio personality.","extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Rhode Island","collection_holder_city":"Providence","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"website_url":null,"record_type":"collection","collection_holder_category":["College or university"],"collection_content_category":["Textual or Photographic Materials"],"physical_formats":null,"creators":null,"subjects":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
