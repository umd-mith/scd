The National Story Project was created and supervised by American author, Paul Auster. The collection primarily contains printed e-mail submissions and letters received through the mail. In addition to the stories, some participants sent cassette tapes or \"CD\"s of themselves reading their stories or performing music to accompany the submission. Also included are books, photographs, newspapers, magazines, pamphlets and other materials either meant to verify their submission as true, add context to their submission, or to show other formats that their submissions had appeared in previously.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"7.5 linear feet","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":["Analog audiocassette","Optical disc (Including CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, VCD)"],"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Textual or Photographic Materials"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-rb/ldpd_7268954/summary","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":"After the National Story Project ended, Auster selected his favorite submissions and compiled them for a book entitled I Thought My Father Was God: And Other True Tales from NPR's National Story Project (Picador, 2002).","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
