These are unlicensed stations created by people setting up transmitters on the roofs of churches and apartment buildings. The Federal Communications Commission has identified New York as a problem area, and Brooklyn, with its diverse immigrant communities, is the epicenter of the city’s pirate scene. Pirates, Goren says, “offer a kind of programming that their audiences depend on. Spiritual sustenance, news, immigration information, music created at home or in the new home, here.” The Brooklyn Pirate Radio Sound Map is a website featuring select clips from many of his discoveries.
