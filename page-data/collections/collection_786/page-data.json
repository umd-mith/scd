Although the most productive portion of his career was brief, he exerted a strong influence on the field of set design and lighting, and was fairly prolific as a writer on theatre. The six audio recordings that comprise the Craig collection originated from a series of BBC radio talks in the early 1950s. The reel to reel tapes include Craigâ€™s reminiscences of Ellen Terry, Isadora Duncan, the old school of acting, celebrities, and how he played Hamlet in Salford, Lancashire.","collection_holder_category":["Personal","College or university"],"collection_holder_name":["UMass Amherst Libraries, Special Collections & University Archives"],"collection_holder_city":"Amherst","collection_holder_state":"Massachusetts","collection_holder_country":"United States","content_types":["Spoken Word"],"dates":"1951/1956","extent":"0.5 linear feet","historical_relevance":null,"physical_formats":["Audio cassette"],"access_statement":null,"finding_aid_url":"http://scua.library.umass.edu/umarmot/craig-edward-gordon/","collection_catalog_url":null,"supporting_documentation":null,"languages":["English"],"inventory_description":["Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)"],"ssp_status":null,"subjects_all":null,"creators":["Craig, Edward Gordon"],"website_url":null},"fields":[{"data":{"Fields":"oclc-number","scd_field_label_revised":null}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-condition","scd_field_label_revised":null}},{"data":{"Fields":"languages","scd_field_label_revised":"Languages"}},{"data":{"Fields":"supporting-documentation","scd_field_label_revised":"Supporting Documentation"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-catalog-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Catalog URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"local-id","scd_field_label_revised":null}},{"data":{"Fields":"finding-aid-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Online Finding Aid"}},{"data":{"Fields":"access-statement","scd_field_label_revised":"Access Statement"}},{"data":{"Fields":"creators","scd_field_label_revised":"Creators"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects-all","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"historical-relevance","scd_field_label_revised":"Historical Relevance"}},{"data":{"Fields":"usage-statement","scd_field_label_revised":null}},{"data":{"Fields":"website-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Website URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"extent","scd_field_label_revised":"Extent"}},{"data":{"Fields":"dates","scd_field_label_revised":"Dates"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-country","scd_field_label_revised":"Country"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-city","scd_field_label_revised":"City"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-name","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Description"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-title","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Title"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection_id","scd_field_label_revised":"id"}},{"data":{"Fields":"ssp-status","scd_field_label_revised":"Sound Submissions Collection?"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"physical-formats","scd_field_label_revised":"Formats"}},{"data":{"Fields":"inventory-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Inventories Available"}},{"data":{"Fields":"content-types","scd_field_label_revised":"Content Types"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-content-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-state","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder State"}},{"data":{"Fields":"record-type","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection or Individual Recording?"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
