Although the most productive portion of his career was brief, he exerted a strong influence on the field of set design and lighting, and was fairly prolific as a writer on theatre. The six audio recordings that comprise the Craig collection originated from a series of BBC radio talks in the early 1950s. The reel to reel tapes include Craigâ€™s reminiscences of Ellen Terry, Isadora Duncan, the old school of acting, celebrities, and how he played Hamlet in Salford, Lancashire.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"0.5 linear feet","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":["Analog audiocassette"],"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Spoken word"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":["Sound recordings"],"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"http://scua.library.umass.edu/umarmot/craig-edward-gordon/","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Massachusetts","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":["Online catalog record"],"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":["English"],"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Amherst","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
