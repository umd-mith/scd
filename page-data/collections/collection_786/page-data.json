Although the most productive portion of his career was brief, he exerted a strong influence on the field of set design and lighting, and was fairly prolific as a writer on theatre. The six audio recordings that comprise the Craig collection originated from a series of BBC radio talks in the early 1950s. The reel to reel tapes include Craigâ€™s reminiscences of Ellen Terry, Isadora Duncan, the old school of acting, celebrities, and how he played Hamlet in Salford, Lancashire.","collection_extent":"0.5 linear feet","collectionFormats":["Analog audiocassette"],"content_types":["Sound recordings"],"collection_finding_aid_url":"http://scua.library.umass.edu/umarmot/craig-edward-gordon/","collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Massachusetts","collection_holder_city":"Amherst","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":["Online catalog record"],"languages":["English"],"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"collection_website_url":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
