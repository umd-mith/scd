Carriger, known as \"Paul the Radio Man,\" was the chief announcer and engineer on Shreveport's KWKY, KRMD and KWEA radio stations and worked for W. K. Henderson. Carriger as an early electronics pioneer formed a corporation in the late 1920s to install and operate television broadcasting stations throughout the South. In the early 1930s his company, the Southern Television and Broadcasting Ccompany, Inc., operated television stations W5XA and W5CBU from the top of Gidden's Castle about 14 miles east of Shreveport on the Minden Road. Because of lack of financial backing, however, all the equipment was sold in 1934.","subjects":["Radio personalities--Louisiana","Radio stations","Television broadcasting"],"creators":["Carriger, Paul L."],"physical_formats":["Open reel tape","Photographic print","Text document"],"access_statement":"Open for research","finding_aid_url":"http://gencat.eloquent-systems.com/lsu_permalink.html?key=1504","collection_catalog_url":null,"supporting_documentation":"Donor agreement","languages":["English"],"inventory_description":["Paper inventory or finding aid","Relational database"]},"fields":[{"data":{"Fields":"inventory-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Inventories Available"}},{"data":{"Fields":"languages","scd_field_label_revised":"Languages"}},{"data":{"Fields":"supporting-documentation","scd_field_label_revised":"Supporting Documentation"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-catalog-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Catalog URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"finding-aid-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Online Finding Aid"}},{"data":{"Fields":"access-statement","scd_field_label_revised":"Access Statement"}},{"data":{"Fields":"historical-relevance","scd_field_label_revised":"Historical Relevance"}},{"data":{"Fields":"extent","scd_field_label_revised":"Extent"}},{"data":{"Fields":"dates","scd_field_label_revised":"Dates"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-country","scd_field_label_revised":"Country"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-city","scd_field_label_revised":"City"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-name","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Description"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-title","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Title"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection_id","scd_field_label_revised":"id"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"creators","scd_field_label_revised":"Creators"}},{"data":{"Fields":"physical-formats","scd_field_label_revised":"Formats"}},{"data":{"Fields":"content-types","scd_field_label_revised":"Content Types"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-content-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-state","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder State"}},{"data":{"Fields":"record-type","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection or Individual Recording?"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
