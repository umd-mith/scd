His work as a Black radio deejay spanned the early days of Black radio in the 1940s through the Civil Rights Movement, and included stints at WERD-Atlanta, WLOU-Louisville, WMBM-Miami, WCIN-Cincinnati, and WABQ-Cleveland. After retiring from radio in 1961, he became a successful music industry executive working for Motown, Decca, and Stax Records. In 1976, he launched the industry magazine Jack the Rapper, the oldest Black trade publication targeted to radio, and for the next twenty years organized the annual \"Jack the Rapperâ€™s Family Affair,\" a Black music convention drawing generations of performers and music industry executives. His professionalism, continuous fight for racial equality and justice, and endearing human qualities made him a legend in the industry. This collection documents his long career in radio and music through personal correspondence, clippings, memorabilia, photographs, publicity materials, airchecks, interviews, lecture materials, and over 500 issues of his trade magazine \"Jack the Rapper's Mellow Yellow.\"","extent":"19 boxes (13 linear feet)","collectionFormats":["Audiocassette","Audiotape reel","Videocassette","Computer disc","Sheet","Analog audiocassette","Open reel tape (unknown material)","VHS (including SVHS and VHS-C)","Optical disc (Including CD, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, DVD-RW, VCD)","Text document","Photographic print"],"content_types":null,"finding_aid_url":"http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/findingaids/view?brand=general&docId=VAD5483.xml&doc.view=entire_text","collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Indiana","collection_holder_city":"Bloomington","collection_catalog_url":"https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/15495126","inventory_description":["EAD finding aid"],"languages":["English"],"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":"All requests for copying and publishing materials must be submitted in writing to the Archives of African American Music and Culture.
