The interviews were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s with a variety of authors, editors, and other publishing industry professionals. Interviewees include Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, Pulitzer Prize winners John Updike and Ray Bradbury, and Booker Prize winners Margaret Atwood and Kazuo Ishiguro. They are unedited, free-flowing conversations that were recorded on inexpensive cassette tapes. Many of these interviews were used by Swaim to create episodes of Book Beat, Swaimâ€™s nationally-syndicated daily book review broadcast for WCBS, which aired 1982-1993. These broadcasts are brief, broadcast-quality snippets containing excerpts from the interviews, often just a minute or two in length.
