The collection consists of reports, lists, reprints of articles, radio spot announcements, summaries of research findings and some RAB publications. In addition, there are by-laws, minutes of an early membership meeting and a report on operations in 1951. The material illustrates the attempts to maintain the attraction of radio as an advertising medium in competition with newspapers, magazines and television. Particularly noteworthy are the files on car radio listening entitled \"Listeners on Wheels,\" the files on television, and the series of twelve reports on the cumulative audience of advertising. There are also files on such targets of radio advertising as women and businessmen. Newsletters cover a wide variety of topics on radio advertising, from general promotion of the medium to specific advice on how to increase advertising effectiveness.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":null,"_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Textual or Photographic Materials"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Wisconsin","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Madison","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
