Because of the fragmentary nature of the papers, the value of the collection lies primarily in the events Back covered rather than its biographical information. Includes news and entertainment scripts Back wrote for KFAB/KFOR, Lincoln, NE, WJSV, Washington, DC and for Whatever Happened To, broadcast on WTOP. Also includes recorded transcripts of Crossfire, the ABC news interview program, transcripts of Congress Today, America's Town Meeting of the Air and Americans At Work and recordings of The Lonesome Road, a radio documentary about alcoholism as well as raw tape interviews apparently used in editing the broadcast. Also includes transcripts for a Lonesome Road program dealing with venereal disease. Photographs are primarily snapshots of Back broadcasting; most are unidentified, but there are snapshots of him with some people prominent in politics and entertainment and also of Back at WJNO, FL. Also includes material related to the Officers Conference, an interview program about world affairs that was aired by the military broadcast network (AFRS?) in the 1950s.","extent":null,"collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"finding_aid_url":null,"collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"Wisconsin","collection_holder_city":"Madison","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"website_url":null,"record_type":"collection","collection_holder_category":["Historical society"],"collection_content_category":["Textual or Photographic Materials","Recorded Sound"],"physical_formats":null,"creators":null,"subjects":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
