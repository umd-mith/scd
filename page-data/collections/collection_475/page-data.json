Kirchner talks about both of his careers: as a teacher and as a composer; about his students; about the performers he used to work with such as violinists Michael Spivakowsky and Isaac Stern; and about electronic tape music. The composer speaks about music by Arnold Schoenberg that influenced him, and he has composed a large quantity of music which is stylistically tied to the works of Schoenberg. He talks about his opera Lily (based on Saul Bellow's Henderson, the Rain King). The composer also discusses each of the following works, excerpts of which are then played during the interview: Music for orchestra (1970), Sonata concertante (for violin and piano, first movement) (1952), Quartet no. 3 (for strings and electronic tape).","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"1 recording","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Recorded Sound"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"http://catalog.nypl.org/search~S1?/X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D/X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D&SUBKEY=%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29/101%2C1177%2C1177%2CB/frameset&FF=X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D&148%2C148%2C","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
