While most of the DJs are African-American, there are a few notable non-African-American figures included as well. The collection spans across nearly every U.S. market. The majority of the material is in digital format, transferred from 2-track reel-to-reel tapes or cassette recordings, with a few requiring minor cleanup (e.g., tape hiss or radio interference). Most of the material is in excellent condition.\n\nKey examples of shows within the collection include airchecks from prominent DJs (ex. \"Sunny Jim\" Kelsey, Frankie Crocker, Mary Dee, Doug ”Jocko” Henderson, Gladys Hill, and Al Gee), and stations (ex. WLIB, WWRP, WOL, KYOK, and WDIA). The provenance of this collection is tied to collector Steve Stein, with major initial contributions from Monica Lynch (WFMU, formerly of Tommy Boy Records), and Rex Doane (WFMU), who were integral in its preservation.","collection_holder_category":["Personal"],"collection_holder_name":["Steve Stein"],"collection_holder_city":"Clinton","collection_holder_state":"New Jersey","collection_holder_country":"United States","content_types":["Airchecks"],"dates":null,"extent":"The collection consists of approximately 1,500 digital files.
