The originals were part of the Sound Archive until 1994, when they left with our former sound archivist. The copies are preservation reel-to-reel tapes and reference cassettes. The recordings date from the mid 1930s through the mid 1950s, and document programs originally aired on WEVD, WCNW, WOR, WNYC, WHN, WBBC, WCBS and WMCA. These include news, variety, human interest and radio dramas, primarily in Yiddish and English. We also have some copies of The Eternal Light radio programs from the 1940s on acetate-on-glass discs.  Additionally, there is a collection of off-air cassettes of WEVD radio programs from the 1970s-90s made by an avid listener, as well as radio programs sponsored by YIVO and by the Workmen's Circle. We also have Yiddish radio programs recorded in Israel (uncatalogued).","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"New York","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
