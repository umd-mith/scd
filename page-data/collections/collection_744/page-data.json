Stationed on the front lines, these units' duties included vectoring pilots to targets, setting up radio relay stations in remote areas, and warning of advancing enemy activity.  The 110th AC&W Squadron was formed in 1950, in response to needs of the Korean War.  The unit was disbanded in 1953, and much of its functions, personnel and equipment were taken over by the 114th AC&W Squadron.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"2 folders","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Textual or Photographic Materials"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"South Carolina","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":"http://rediscov.sc.gov/scar/default.asp?IDCFile=detailss.idc,SPECIFIC=8630,DATABASE=SERIES,","_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":["English"],"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Columbia","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":"All materials in this collection are considered public domain and may be freely used.
