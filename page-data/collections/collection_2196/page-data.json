Correspondence, 1926-1962, chiefly concerns Broadcast Pioneers, the National Association of Broadcasters, the \"Chicago Daily News\" and WMAQ. The limited NBC material is best for the inception of television during the late 1940s. Also includes speeches and articles, clippings, memorabilia, a transcript of an oral history interview and a number of NBC reports, including some by Hedges. Material pertaining to Broadcast Pioneers includes minutes, printed matter, issues of the group's in-house organ and material on its history project. Of special interest is Hedges's interview with John F. Royal and the inventories of the project's collection. Information on the NAB, of which Hedges was a founding member, includes a constitution and by-laws, a proposed code of fair competition, convention programs and a handbook. Photographs document a group of journalists, including Hedges, on Broadcasters' Mission to Europe, 1945.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":null,"_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Textual or Photographic Materials"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Wisconsin","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Madison","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
