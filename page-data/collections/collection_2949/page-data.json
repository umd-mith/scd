The recordings selected for digitization are part of the Vernon “Dr. Daddy-O” Winslow collection, HJA-055, of the Hogan Archive of New Orleans Music and New Orleans Jazz, a division of Tulane University Special Collections, and were chosen among over 3,000 78 RPM disc records of commercially released music recordings and recorded broadcasts that Winslow played on WWEZ. Originally airing between 1949 and 1958, these recordings represent the emergence of Black radio in New Orleans, while featuring Winslow's work as the first African American radio disc jockey on New Orleans airwaves. \"Jivin' with Jax,\" sponsored by New Orleans' Jackson Brewery beer company, would become the first full-length radio program in New Orleans to feature a Black DJ and specifically cater to and develop a Black listenership. The recordings were digitized with funding by a grant from the GRAMMY Museum®, awarded in 2019.\n\nThe sound recordings in this digital collection include Winslow's hosting of remote broadcasts, and his personalized advertisements and endorsements for New Orleans bars, music clubs, Jax Beer, and J&M Recording Studio, among others. Also included are Winslow's conversations with internationally renowned Black celebrities, such as music luminaries Roy Brown, Savannah Churchill, Duke Ellington, Avery \"Kid\" Howard, Ivory Joe Hunter, Louis Jordan, Big Maceo Merriweather, Little Esther Phillips, Professor Longhair, and Roosevelt Sykes; professional baseball legends Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe; and local figures such as Roland Brown, the 1951 king of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club. Non-commercially issued music is also included, featuring performances by the Dave Bartholomew Orchestra, and by the Golden Chain Jubileers, a New Orleans-based gospel warhorse quartet.","collection_holder_category":["College or university"],"collection_holder_name":null,"collection_holder_city":"New Orleans","collection_holder_state":"Louisiana","collection_holder_country":null,"content_types":["rectdePH7va1BgXUe","recbFDPLLrEQgrGHF"],"dates":"1949","extent":"The digital collection of broadcast recordings represent 25 recordings.
