Flett was born February 28, 1915 in Milbank, South Dakota. He graduated from Morningside College, Sioux City IA in 1938. Broadcasting was his passion and as a young boy in the Midwest, he'd listen to W.K. Henderson's \"Hello World! Doggone Ya!\" broadcast from the 50,000 watt KWKH radio station in Shreveport, Louisiana. When he returned from the war, he moved south in 1946 to join KWKH as a sports announcer. In 1953, he served as project manager who obtained the television license for KSLA TV, the first in the area. He worked at KSLA for eleven years, then moved to KTBS as station manager. Flett worked in the broadcasting business for thirty-five years, twenty-two of those in television in Shreveport. He died June 23, 2009.","subjects":["Radio","Television broadcasting"],"creators":["Flett, Deane Roberts"],"physical_formats":["Photographic print","Text document"],"access_statement":"Open for research","finding_aid_url":"http://gencat.eloquent-systems.com/lsu_permalink.html?key=2635","collection_catalog_url":null,"supporting_documentation":"Donor agreement","languages":["English"],"inventory_description":["Paper inventory or finding aid","Relational database"]},"fields":[{"data":{"Fields":"inventory-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Inventories Available"}},{"data":{"Fields":"languages","scd_field_label_revised":"Languages"}},{"data":{"Fields":"supporting-documentation","scd_field_label_revised":"Supporting Documentation"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-catalog-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Catalog URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"finding-aid-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Online Finding Aid"}},{"data":{"Fields":"access-statement","scd_field_label_revised":"Access Statement"}},{"data":{"Fields":"historical-relevance","scd_field_label_revised":"Historical Relevance"}},{"data":{"Fields":"extent","scd_field_label_revised":"Extent"}},{"data":{"Fields":"dates","scd_field_label_revised":"Dates"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-country","scd_field_label_revised":"Country"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-city","scd_field_label_revised":"City"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-name","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Description"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-title","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Title"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection_id","scd_field_label_revised":"id"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"creators","scd_field_label_revised":"Creators"}},{"data":{"Fields":"physical-formats","scd_field_label_revised":"Formats"}},{"data":{"Fields":"content-types","scd_field_label_revised":"Content Types"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-content-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-state","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder State"}},{"data":{"Fields":"record-type","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection or Individual Recording?"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
