Yardumian talks about his musical family, his older brother Elijah Yardumian, a concert pianist and a product of the Curtis Institute, who served as a musical mentor to his younger brother; about his career as a composer, and his early start to composing at age 14 even before he began his formal musical education. He discusses the twelve-note technique that he created (not the same as twelve-tone system, used in conjunction with the music of Schoenberg and other twelve-tone composers). The composer also discusses each of the following works, excerpts of which are then played during the interview: Armenian suite, Desolate city, Violin concerto (1949), Piano concerto (second and third movements) (1957), and two excerpts from the mass Come Creator Spirit: Holy, Holy, Holy (Sanctus) and Lamb of God (Agnus Dei) (dedicated to the 125th anniversary of Fordham University) (1966).","collection_holder_category":["Municipal"],"collection_holder_name":["New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B.
