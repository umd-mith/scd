Along with sound man Gene Twombly, Cosby and Buxton improvised the episodes, which were syndicated to more than 200 top-40 radio stations around the nation on transcription discs by The Coca-Cola Company and distributed by McCann-Erikson (Coke’s ad agency). The show marked the beginning of Cosby’s long association with Coca-Cola and was the debut of many characters from Cosby’s comedy. This collection features twelve radio broadcast transcription discs (one 12-inch disc and eleven 16-inch discs) of \"The Bill Cosby Radio Program\" containing programs #21-130 (1968 Jan 29-Jun 24) and programs #141-145 (1968 Jul 15).
