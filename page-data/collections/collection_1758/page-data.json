Thompson continued to perform regularly and released several recordings as both soloist and bandleader until his retirement in 1985. The collection includes photographs and sound recordings documenting Thompson's musical career. Photographs feature Thompson, his bandmates, and associates during the 1940s and 1950s, and include several promotional shots of Thompson, the Blue Ridge Entertainers, and the Dixie Playboys. Photographs also document Thompson's involvement with Danville, Va., radio station WDVA and his performance at a number of venues, including the WDVA Barn Dance, the Carolina Theatre (Burlington), a voting rally, a WTOB (Winston-Salem) television show, and several radio stations. Also included are photographs of comedians who performed in Thompson's stage show, most commonly long-time bandmate Sleepy Johnson and WDVA personality Homer T (Thomasson). Other performers include Charlie Monroe; armless musician Ray R. Meyers; and the Louvin Brothers. Sound recordings include CD copies of commercial 78 rpm records and LP records; original 45 rpm records; and cassettes and compact discs issued privately by Thompson or by the Greensboro-based Skatter label. A taped interview, in which Thompson comments on the collection's photographs, provides anecdotes about Buck Owens, Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, the Louvins, Ray Meyers, Thompson's bandmates, and Thompson's musical experiences in Danville and Burlington.\n\n","collection_holder_category":["College or university"],"collection_holder_name":["Southern Folklife Collection"],"collection_holder_city":"Chapel Hill","collection_holder_state":"North Carolina","collection_holder_country":"United States","content_types":["Photographs","Music Programs"],"dates":"1944-2002","extent":null,"historical_relevance":null,"physical_formats":null,"access_statement":null,"finding_aid_url":"https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/catalog/20341","collection_catalog_url":null,"supporting_documentation":null,"languages":null,"inventory_description":null,"ssp_status":null,"subjects_all":["Music: Country & Folk","U.S. Regions: South"],"creators":null,"website_url":"http://library.unc.edu/wilson/sfc/"},"fields":[{"data":{"Fields":"languages","scd_field_label_revised":"Languages"}},{"data":{"Fields":"supporting-documentation","scd_field_label_revised":"Supporting Documentation"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-catalog-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Catalog URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"finding-aid-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Online Finding Aid"}},{"data":{"Fields":"access-statement","scd_field_label_revised":"Access Statement"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects-all","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"historical-relevance","scd_field_label_revised":"Historical Relevance"}},{"data":{"Fields":"website-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Website URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"extent","scd_field_label_revised":"Extent"}},{"data":{"Fields":"dates","scd_field_label_revised":"Dates"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-country","scd_field_label_revised":"Country"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-city","scd_field_label_revised":"City"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-name","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Description"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-title","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Title"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection_id","scd_field_label_revised":"id"}},{"data":{"Fields":"ssp-status","scd_field_label_revised":"Sound Submissions Collection?"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"creators","scd_field_label_revised":"Creators"}},{"data":{"Fields":"physical-formats","scd_field_label_revised":"Formats"}},{"data":{"Fields":"inventory-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Inventories Available"}},{"data":{"Fields":"content-types","scd_field_label_revised":"Content Types"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-content-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-state","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder State"}},{"data":{"Fields":"record-type","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection or Individual Recording?"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
