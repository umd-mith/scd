While the program first aired in 1982, the earliest recordings were not preserved by WILL. Records of the program begin in 1982, but the earliest extant audio archives date from 1986. From 1982 to 2000 the program was recorded to analog 1/8\" audio cassette tape, but not every tape from this period was preserved. Beginning in 2000 the program was recorded on audio Compact Discs, and later directly to digital files (audio/wav) on network storage. The set of audio recordings is most complete from about 2000 to 2014, when production of Focus 580 ended.","collection_usage_statement":"All collection materials that are accessible online may be used, quoted, and shared without permission for educational, journalistic, and scholarly purposes.
