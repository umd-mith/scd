NFCB was formed by a group of community broadcasters who envisioned the creation of a program-sharing cooperative for community radio stations, which would come to be known as the NFCB Program Service. NFCB's early mission also included the creation of training manuals for radio station staff, assisting stations in obtaining Federal Communication Commission licenses, and promoting the participation of minorities and women in public broadcasting. The collection documents NFCB's administrative activities, its work with member stations and community groups, training and licensing work, as well as its advocacy work and radio awards programs. A significant portion of the collection comprises the audio reels and paper records of the NFCB Program Service, which promoted the sharing of content among community radio stations by collecting and distributing radio programs created by independent producers from across the United States, many of which have been digitized.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":null,"_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Textual or Photographic Materials","Recorded Sound"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/1596","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Maryland","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"College Park","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
