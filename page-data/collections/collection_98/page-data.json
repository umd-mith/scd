The show is an almost encyclopedic collection of conversations, interviews, and documentaries about the most pressing economic, political, and social problems facing Baltimore in the years 1993- 2008. Interviews with elites and homeless, artists and activists, and most important of all perhaps, the voice of the listener-callers, who helped define the tone of the program. While too modern to fit into the parameters of this project, I think itâ€™s value to historians and political scientists and cultural studies scholars presents an argument for its inclusion and for rethinking the narrow time frame of this project.","subjects":null,"creators":null,"physical_formats":null,"access_statement":null,"finding_aid_url":null,"collection_catalog_url":null,"supporting_documentation":null,"languages":null,"inventory_description":["Paper inventory or finding aid"]},"fields":[{"data":{"Fields":"inventory-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Inventories Available"}},{"data":{"Fields":"languages","scd_field_label_revised":"Languages"}},{"data":{"Fields":"supporting-documentation","scd_field_label_revised":"Supporting Documentation"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-catalog-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Catalog URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"finding-aid-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Online Finding Aid"}},{"data":{"Fields":"access-statement","scd_field_label_revised":"Access Statement"}},{"data":{"Fields":"historical-relevance","scd_field_label_revised":"Historical Relevance"}},{"data":{"Fields":"extent","scd_field_label_revised":"Extent"}},{"data":{"Fields":"dates","scd_field_label_revised":"Dates"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-country","scd_field_label_revised":"Country"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-city","scd_field_label_revised":"City"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-name","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Description"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-title","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Title"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection_id","scd_field_label_revised":"id"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"creators","scd_field_label_revised":"Creators"}},{"data":{"Fields":"physical-formats","scd_field_label_revised":"Formats"}},{"data":{"Fields":"content-types","scd_field_label_revised":"Content Types"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-content-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-state","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder State"}},{"data":{"Fields":"record-type","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection or Individual Recording?"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
