Hoiby talks about both of his careers: as a pianist and composer. Though at first he intended to pursue a career as a concert pianist, today he is more interested in composing, he says. The composer speaks about his early interest in composing, his background, his studies at Mills College, and then later at the Curtis Institute of Music with Gian Carlo Menotti, his life in New York City. He discusses various of his works such as two operas: Summer and smoke, and Natalia Petrovna; and the music he composed for two balets: After Eden (choreography by John Butler) and Suite for orchestra for Hearts, meadows, and flags (choreography by Richard Wagner). Excepts of two ballets are played during the interview.","extent":"1 recording","collectionFormats":null,"content_types":null,"finding_aid_url":"http://catalog.nypl.org/search~S1?/X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D/X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D&SUBKEY=%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29/101%2C1177%2C1177%2CB/frameset&FF=X%28%28radio%29+and+%28broadcast%29%29&searchscope=1&Da=1919&Db=1981&m=p&m=m&m=q&m=-&m=y&m=j&SORT=D&144%2C144%2C","collection_holder_country":"United States","collection_holder_state":"New York","collection_holder_city":"New York","collection_catalog_url":null,"inventory_description":null,"languages":null,"collection_notes":null,"collection_usage_statement":null,"website_url":null,"record_type":"collection","collection_holder_category":["Municipal"],"collection_content_category":["Recorded Sound"],"physical_formats":null,"creators":null,"subjects":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
