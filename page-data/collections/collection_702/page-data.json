They are organized in the categories Radio, Motion Pictures, Television, and Theatre. There are also 104 scrapbooks, whose contents overlap the materials in the other series and include all Moorehead's correspondence (including greeting cards for all occasions), clippings, programs, photographs, and miscellany, 1928-1973. In addition, the collection includes files of materials submitted to Moorehead for her review but rejected by her, and miscellany. This collection extensively documents Moorehead's exceptional career, in which she was continuously employed as an actress, often in several media simultaneously, for forty-five years.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"67.0 c.f.
