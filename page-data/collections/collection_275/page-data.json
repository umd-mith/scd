It was an \"underground\" radio program broadcast on a clear-channel station from Little Rock.  The host was Clyde Clifford, and the signal blanketed the Midwest and reached Cuba.  \"Beaker Street\" has never received its due as a popularizer of alternative music in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s.  I’ve mastered the recordings onto CD, and the broadcast dates are as follows: June 26, 1970 – one hour June 28, 1970 – one hour July 3, 1970 – one hour April 13, 1971 – two hours August 14, 1971 – one hour December 31, 1971 – two hours March 3, 1985 (final show) – one hour","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
