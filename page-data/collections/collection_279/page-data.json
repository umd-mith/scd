In 1938, she was denied the right to appear on stage because of the Nazi occupation of Austria, the Nuremberg Laws, and her father's Jewish background. On Christmas Eve 1938, she escaped to America with a nearly expired Austrian passport and began her singing career. Shortly thereafter, she met Eleanor Roosevelt's bodyguard, who introduced her to the First Lady, beginning a close friendship that lasted until Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962.","_xxxcollectionExtentxtxt":"Approximately 120 recordings, microfilm, 4.6 feet, paper copies","_xcollectionFormatsxtxtxxxcollectionFormatsxtxt":["Text document","Open reel tape (unknown material)"],"_xxxcollectionContentTypesxtxtxxxcollectionContentTypesxtxt":["Performed music","Spoken word"],"_xxxcollectionGenresxtxtxxxcollectionGenresxtxt":["Historical"],"_xxxcollectionFindingAidUrlxtxt":"http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/shedd.htm","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCountryxtxt":"United States","_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationStatextxt":"Delaware","_xxxcollectionCatalogUrlxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxtxxxcollectionInventoryDescriptionxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionLanguagesxtxtxxxcollectionLanguagesxtxt":["English"],"_xxxcollectionNotesxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionOwnerLocationCityxtxt":"Newark","_xxxcollectionUsageStatementxtxt":null,"_xxxcollectionWebsiteUrlxtxt":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
