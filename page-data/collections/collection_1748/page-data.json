Starting in the late 1970s, dubs (on reel) of the program were offered for free to other non-commercial/public radio stations, including WDCB/Glen Ellyn, IL, WSSU/Superior, WI, WUWM/Milwaukee, WI; WGBW/Green Bay, WI; KICB/Fort Dodge, IA; WXPR/Rhinelander, WI; KSMU/Springfield, MO and possibly WHIL/Mobile, AL. It also aired briefly on commercial station KIFZ-AM/Fond du Lac, WI. The one hour program often had a theme, while others sampled new releases and to add context, Snyder would share what then-new releases were reviewed ten years' prior in Downbeat magazine. Program engineering was always the duty of a student in Radio TV Film at UW Oshkosh, where Snyder was the founder of the major and its academic coordinator. NOTE: After his death in 2008, Snyder's jazz collection of recordings, magazines and other material was willed to the UW Oshkosh music department which holds it in a special collection (for info: 920-424-4224 or music@uwosh.edu)","physical_formats":null,"access_statement":"Contact WRST-FM at 920-424-7427 or UW Oshkosh Radio TV Film at 920-424-3131 for access.","finding_aid_url":null,"collection_catalog_url":null,"supporting_documentation":"Production records and program notes (with collection)","languages":["English"],"inventory_description":null,"ssp_status":null,"subjects":["rec4RyfwmLZJqPygb","recWzw4XTQ9mTtBFW","recC3CjdcUoOvF0fP","recHqiKaqnfeDtjQG"],"creators":["Snyder, Dr. Robert","WRST-FM","University of Wisconsin Oshkosh"]},"fields":[{"data":{"Fields":"languages","scd_field_label_revised":"Languages"}},{"data":{"Fields":"supporting-documentation","scd_field_label_revised":"Supporting Documentation"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-catalog-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Catalog URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"finding-aid-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Online Finding Aid"}},{"data":{"Fields":"access-statement","scd_field_label_revised":"Access Statement"}},{"data":{"Fields":"historical-relevance","scd_field_label_revised":"Historical Relevance"}},{"data":{"Fields":"website-url","scd_field_label_revised":"Website URL"}},{"data":{"Fields":"extent","scd_field_label_revised":"Extent"}},{"data":{"Fields":"dates","scd_field_label_revised":"Dates"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-country","scd_field_label_revised":"Country"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-city","scd_field_label_revised":"City"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-name","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Description"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-title","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Title"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection_id","scd_field_label_revised":"id"}},{"data":{"Fields":"ssp-status","scd_field_label_revised":"Sound Submissions Collection?"}},{"data":{"Fields":"subjects","scd_field_label_revised":"Subjects"}},{"data":{"Fields":"creators","scd_field_label_revised":"Creators"}},{"data":{"Fields":"physical-formats","scd_field_label_revised":"Formats"}},{"data":{"Fields":"inventory-description","scd_field_label_revised":"Inventories Available"}},{"data":{"Fields":"content-types","scd_field_label_revised":"Content Types"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-content-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-category","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder Category"}},{"data":{"Fields":"collection-holder-state","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection Holder State"}},{"data":{"Fields":"record-type","scd_field_label_revised":"Collection or Individual Recording?"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
