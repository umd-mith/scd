The RPTF/ARSC Sound Collections Database is supported by the Radio Preservation Task Force, National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress (RPTF) and ARSC (Association for Recorded Sound Collections). It includes information gathered by the RPTF, and the information will be edited and enhanced over time. We will also be making changes to this site’s appearance and functionality based on user feedback. The Task Force is also seeking out additional collections to list in the database.

The database is managed by the RPTF’s Metadata Directors, William Vanden Dries (Indiana University) and Mark Matienzo (Stanford University). This is the third iteration of this database. The first and second iterations were built using the open source Blacklight project. If you have comments about the data or search interface please contact Mark or William by email.
